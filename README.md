## Motivation
Struggling to decide on the perfect engineering project is a common dilemma for every aspiring student. The vast array of technologies and endless possibilities can be overwhelming, leaving students unsure of where to begin their journey. This uncertainty can hinder creativity and hinder the development of critical skills. To address this challenge, I propose the creation of a unique and empowering project: Find My Project. The motivation behind this project is to provide a valuable solution that aids engineering students in discovering exciting and relevant project ideas based on their preferred technologies.

## Goal
The primary goal of Find My Project is to inspire students and guide them towards projects that align with their interests and ambitions. Through a user-friendly web application, students will have the opportunity to input their preferred technologies and Find My Project will then fetch and display a collection of the most popular and admired projects that match those criteria.
